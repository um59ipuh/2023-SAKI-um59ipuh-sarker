# Project Plan

## Summary

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 5 sentences. -->
**Project Title: Analyzing the Relationship between Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure and Sales Data in Germany.**

The objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure and monthly sales data for EVs in each state of Germany. The project will use data on charging station locations and monthly sales data for every state in Germany to identify patterns and relationships between charging infrastructure and EV sales.

## Rationale

<!-- Outline the impact of the analysis, e.g. which pains it solves. -->
By analyzing this relationship, we could identify areas where improvements in charging infrastructure could lead to increased EV adoption and also the project could help city planners and transportation officials plan for the development of EV charging infrastructure more effectively.


## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
